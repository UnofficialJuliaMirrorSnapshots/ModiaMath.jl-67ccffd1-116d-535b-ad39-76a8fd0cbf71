# Constants and Types

The following **constants** are defined in ModiaMath (all these
definitions are not exported and therefore need to be prefixed with ModiaMath):

- `const path`\
  Absolute path of ModiaMath package directory. This allows for example to run ModiaMath examples
  as `include("$(ModiaMath.path)/examples/Simulate_Pendulum.jl")`.

- `const Version`\
  Version of ModiaMath

- `const Date`\
  Version Date of ModiaMath


The following **abstract types** are defined and used in ModiaMath:

```@autodocs
Modules = [ModiaMath]
Order = [:type]
```
